# Hi 👋 I'm Branith

**Software Engineer** · Occasional overthinker · Professional debugger

I build things that run.  
Then I make them run better.  
Then I refactor them because I had an idea.

I dig into business logic — sometimes deeper than I need to —  
but that’s usually where the interesting problems are.

## 🧠 About Me

Full-stack engineer with a strong backend bias.

I like untangling messy requirements, giving them structure,  
and turning them into systems that actually make sense.

*Off the keyboard: cats and anime. A lot of both.*

## 💻 Languages

I work with:

| **Backend** | **Frontend & mobile** | **Other** |
|-------------|------------------------|-----------|
| C# / .NET   | JavaScript & TypeScript | SQL (many dialects) |
| Java (Spring) | Dart (Flutter)       | Bash      |
| Python (Flask, automation) | HTML5 / CSS3 | |

---

## 🧱 Backend & Systems

- ASP.NET Core · Node.js · Spring-based services  
- REST APIs that behave  
- Auth flows · Nginx · Redis · Background jobs  
- Logic that actually matches the business

**Databases:** PostgreSQL, MSSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite  
*(At least one weird query debugged in each.)*

---

## 🌐 Frontend & Cross-Platform

- React & React Native · Flutter  
- HTML5 / CSS3 / Bootstrap · Figma-driven UI

---

## ☁️ Cloud & DevOps

- AWS · Azure · Docker · Linux  
- Git workflows · CI/CD

If it goes to production, I want logs.  
If there are logs, I want dashboards.  
*(Grafana has seen things.)*

**Tooling:** Postman, Cypress, Puppeteer



---

## 🤝 What I Like Working On

- Backend-heavy systems  
- Cloud and architecture  
- Performance tuning  
- Automation  

If it’s complex and a bit intimidating, that’s often a good sign.

## 🔭 Right Now

**Building:** socio-economical analysis automation.  
**Learning:** ML — I am just hopeful it could one day help out.

## 🧩 One More Thing

Started building early. Started teaching early.  
Still learning.  
*(Still rewatching that one anime. Still explaining to the cat why the build failed.)*

**Unabashed favorites:** World of Warcraft, and **D.Gray-man** —  
if you haven’t seen it, consider this a strong recommendation.
